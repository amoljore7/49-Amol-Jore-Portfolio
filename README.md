# Getting Started with Create React App

Unable to resolve dependency tree error in React while installing npm packages

1) Run npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps instead of npm install command.
2) Another way is :delete node_modules folder and package_lock.json file and then run npm cache clean --force after npm i --force command.
